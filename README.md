# AI-Driven-Delay-Prediction-and-Optimization-for-Train-Scheduling
This project builds a deep learning regression model to predict arrival and departure delays of high-speed trains based on operational and environmental factors.

Project Overview
Uses a dataset of train operation records and weather data.
Predicts both arrival delays and departure delays.
Employs a deep learning approach (DNN with Keras/TensorFlow) for regression-based predictions.
Provides insights that can be applied to scheduling optimization, resource allocation, and passenger experience improvements.

Technologies Used
Python (Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation)
TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Neural Network)
Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, train/test split, scaling, label encoding)
Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation and cleaning)
